I have created this project website during doing a course from Udemy named [**Advanced CSS**](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. The design and instruction credit goes to my instructor. <br>

I have learned a lot of new things about CSS in this course. Among them, some things that are worth mentioning... <br><br>
- How to write scaleable and maintainable CSS.
- CSS Preprocessor: SASS.
- 7-1 SASS Architecture.
- CSS Animation. And many more...
